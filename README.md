# 0k — Claude Code Plugin

The 0k Claude Code plugin: a curated set of skills and references that
encode the 0k-software development workflow — issue creation, PR review,
plan-driven implementation, branch hygiene, and a few quality-of-life
helpers.

This repository **is** the plugin. Its root is the plugin root, with
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` declaring the manifest. Claude Code installs
it directly from this repo via the marketplace mechanism (see
[Installing](#installing-the-plugin) below).

> Previously hosted at `0k-software/.github/0k`. This repo is now the
> canonical home; the install path has changed accordingly.

## Installing the plugin

From any Claude Code session, register the marketplace and install:

```
/plugin marketplace add 0k-software/kata
/plugin install kata@0k-software
```

Once installed, every skill is available as `/kata:<skill-name>`.

| Action      | Command                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Update      | `/plugin update kata@0k-software`    |
| Uninstall   | `/plugin uninstall kata@0k-software` |
| List skills | `/plugin info kata@0k-software`      |

### Enabling across an org's projects

Add this to a project's `.claude/settings.json` to register the marketplace
and auto-enable the plugin for everyone who opens the project:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "0k-software": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "0k-software/kata"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "kata@0k-software": true
  }
}
```

This is the standard Claude Code mechanism for distributing plugins to a
team — no custom scripts or hooks required. Claude Code handles
installation and updates automatically. See the
[plugin marketplaces docs][cc-plugin-marketplaces] for details.

## Skills

Every skill is a directory under `skills/` with a `SKILL.md` defining its
frontmatter (name, description, argument hint) and behavior. Each skill is
invoked from a Claude Code session as `/kata:<skill-name>`.

### Workflow

| Skill            | Invocation           | Purpose                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `commit`         | `/kata:commit`         | Stage all changes (staged, unstaged, untracked) and generate a Conventional Commit. Use `!` prefix to auto-fix errors instead of aborting. |
| `create-issue`   | `/kata:create-issue`   | Create a GitHub issue in an 0k-software repo using the standardized templates (pitch, feature, task, bug, enhancement, kickoff). |
| `create-pr`      | `/kata:create-pr`      | Open a pull request for the current branch with consistent formatting and automatic issue linking. Pass `draft` to open as a draft. |
| `rebase`         | `/kata:rebase`         | Rebase current branch onto another, handling pre-commit hook failures. `/kata:rebase!` auto-resolves conflicts where safe. |
| `cleanup-branch` | `/kata:cleanup-branch` | Squash back-and-forth, WIP, and fixup commits into a clean, reviewable history — without changing the final diff.    |
| `split-branch`   | `/kata:split-branch`   | Split a large branch into smaller stacked branches (≤500 changed lines each) so PRs are easier to review.            |
| `kitty`          | `/kata:kitty`          | Open or activate a [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) terminal in the current directory.                      |

### Plan-driven implementation

These skills cooperate around a `PLAN.md` file at the repo root. The
canonical schema lives in
[`references/PLAN_FORMAT.md`](references/PLAN_FORMAT.md) — every plan-* skill
reads it before acting.

| Skill          | Invocation         | Purpose                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `plan-init`    | `/kata:plan-init`    | Fetch a GitHub issue, design step-by-step implementation, write `PLAN.md`, commit, and open a draft PR. |
| `plan-add`     | `/kata:plan-add`     | Add a new step to an existing `PLAN.md` while preserving the format.                     |
| `plan-execute` | `/kata:plan-execute` | Autonomously run all remaining plan steps — implement, commit, repeat — until the plan is complete. |

### Refinement & feedback

| Skill           | Invocation          | Purpose                                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `refine`        | `/kata:refine`        | Brainstorm and refine a GitHub issue into a concrete spec before any code is written. Use this before any creative work. |
| `fix`           | `/kata:fix`           | Address unresolved feedback on a PR **or** an issue — routes to `fix-pr` or `fix-issue`.                                |
| `fix-pr`        | `/kata:fix-pr`        | Address unresolved review comments on a pull request — verify before implementing, push back when technically wrong, commit through `/kata:commit`. |
| `fix-issue`     | `/kata:fix-issue`     | Address unresolved comments on a GitHub issue — update description, reply to feedback, mark addressed with 👀.          |
| `address`       | `/kata:address`       | Alias for `/kata:fix`.                                                                                                    |
| `address-pr`    | `/kata:address-pr`    | Alias for `/kata:fix-pr`.                                                                                                 |
| `address-issue` | `/kata:address-issue` | Alias for `/kata:fix-issue`.                                                                                              |

## References

Static reference material consumed by skills lives under `references/`:

- **`references/PLAN_FORMAT.md`** — canonical structure for `PLAN.md` files,
  shared by every `plan-*` skill.
- **`references/templates/`** — GitHub issue templates used by
  `/kata:create-issue`:

  | File                | Purpose                                        |
  | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
  | `1-pitch.yml`       | Propose a new project                          |
  | `2-feature.yml`     | New feature request                            |
  | `3-task.yml`        | Infrastructure, migration, or setup work       |
  | `4-bug.yml`         | Bug report with severity                       |
  | `5-enhancement.yml` | Refactor, DevX, or performance improvement     |
  | `6-kickoff.yml`     | Pre-flight checklist before starting a project |

  Templates are tailored for an **Elixir/Phoenix** stack (Phoenix, Ecto,
  Oban, Backpex, PhoenixTest).

## Contributing

Skills are plain Markdown — open the relevant `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`,
edit the frontmatter and body, and submit a PR. The frontmatter
`description` is what Claude Code uses to decide when a skill is relevant,
so keep it sharp and trigger-rich.

Useful local checks:

```sh
npx prettier --check "**/*.md"   # Markdown formatting
npx prettier --write "**/*.md"   # auto-fix
```

To iterate interactively, open a Claude Code session in this repo and
invoke the skill — edits to `SKILL.md` are picked up on the next call.

## Releasing a new version

1. Bump `version` in [`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`](.claude-plugin/plugin.json).
2. Commit and push.
3. Tag the commit with the matching version (e.g. `v1.1.0`) and publish a
   GitHub release. Claude Code picks up the new version on its next
   `/plugin update` check.
